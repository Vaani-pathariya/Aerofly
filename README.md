### Project Demo link

## About
This is a flight delay prediction project that helps passangers predict if a paticular flight will be delayed or not , as well as the airlines by enabling them to attempt a double security check of the airplanes that we predicted to be delayed as this could be because those airplanes have been in use for many missions and now require some checking of their parts
### Description
#### Features implemented :<br>
-> Signup and Signin facility that can be used to make the experience more friendly<br>
-> prediction on the basis of time , length , airline , etc , if the flight will be delayed or not<br>
-> an easy to understand ui<br>
-> Added a section for people to add their last flight experience if they wish , this data can be added to the data set and make the accuracy of the model higher.

### Set up Project
For getting the site on your local :
```
git clone https://github.com/Vaani-pathariya/Aerofly.git
cd Aerofly 
```
For running the frontend on your local host : after the above steps :
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
the frontend will run at localhost:3000<br>
For running the backend: after setting up the site on local
```
cd backend 
npm install
npm start
```
### Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed on your local to replicate the project:<br>
-> Nodejs<br>
-> Python<br>
-> ensure that you have the child_process module installed in python
### Vision and Future Improvements :
-> Right now the project is built with Random Forest Classification algorithm , I plan to test out other models as well to test if we can get higher accuracy<br>
-> Implementing weather features to improve accuracy<br>
-> Adding multiple languages to display according to the language entered by the user in signup.<br>
-> Reducing the size of model.<br>
-> Increasing the speed , so that the model runs faster.
